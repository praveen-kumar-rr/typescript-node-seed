# Typescript Node Seed

A minimalistic typescript node starter. Also container basic webpack configuration.
Created using tn-init.

After cloning. Just run the following command to get started.

`npm i` - To install all the node modules.

`npm run ts-node src/index.ts` - To run the ts file directly (You can run any ts file).

`npm i webpack webpack-cli -g` - To install webpack and its cli globally.

`webpack` - To build the ts file (modify the entry and output filename in webpack.config.js if needed).

*Note:*
Lodash and axios is added, to get started with basic utility functions and http requests and responses.

#### Configure as per your need. Happy Hacking!
